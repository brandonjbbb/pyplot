# Pyplot Assignment

### By Brandon 

This repository contains the solutions for a Python data visualization assignment using the Matplotlib library. The assignment reinforces key skills in Python data visualization and Jupyter Notebook usage, with a focus on creating clear, informative plots using Matplotlib's `pyplot` module.

## Project Overview

The tasks in this assignment include:
1. **Character Frequency Bar Plot** - Visualizing the frequency of each character in a given text string.
2. **Scatter and Line Plot of Random Numbers** - Generating random numbers and visualizing them using both scatter and line plots on separate axes.
3. **Customized Scatter and Line Plot** - Modifying the style and color of scatter and line plots to demonstrate customization.
4. **Sorting Algorithm Execution Time Comparison** - Comparing execution times of insertion sort and merge sort algorithms on lists of varying sizes, with a combined plot for easy comparison.

## Repository Contents

- **pyplot.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with all tasks completed, including code, visualizations, and Markdown explanations.
- **pyplot.html**: HTML export of the notebook for easy viewing without a Jupyter environment.

## How to View

- To view the code and visualizations interactively, open `pyplot.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- Alternatively, you can view the static HTML version by opening `pyplot.html` in your browser.

## Key Libraries Used

- **Matplotlib**: Used for all data visualizations in this assignment.
- **Random**: Used to generate random numbers for visualizations.
